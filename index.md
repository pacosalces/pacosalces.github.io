### About
<p style="color:Peru;"> I was born in San Luis Potosi, Mexico where I got my physics major at the Facultad de Ciencias of the Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosi in 2013. Throughout my undergraduate education I had the joy of working in <a href="https://www.ifisica.uaslp.mx/~egomez/">Prof. Eduardo Gomez lab</a> at the Instituto de Fisica, UASLP developing thermally ultrastable optical cavities with applications in atom gravimetry and quantum sensors. </p>

<p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> I then completed my PhD at the University of Maryland College Park in 2020 working in <a href="https://ultracold.jqi.umd.edu/">Ian Spielman's RbChip lab</a> as a NIST guest researcher for the Joint Quantum Institute. My <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1903/26123"> doctoral dissertation</a> focused on experiments with elongated ultracold bosonic gases for quantum simulation, where we developed <i>in-situ</i> imaging techniques to probe the local thermodynamics of low-dimensional bosonic gases, as well as digital holographic aberration correction techniques. I certainly like all things microscopy and quantum gases! </p>

<p style="color:LightCoral;"> I am currently the Barish-Weiss postdoctoral fellow in <a href="https://caltechexperimentalgravity.github.io/">Rana X. Adhikari's experimental gravity</a> group in Caltech. I am collaborating with Mariner; a 40-meter prototype of next-generation cryogenic gravitational wave detectors, where I am focused in low-noise lasers in the short wave infrarred band (~ 2 um) and their downstream adaptation for experimental gravity. </p>

<p style="color:forestgreen;">  I am broadly interested in combining advanced interferometric techniques in quantum and classical systems to advance fundamental physics; including light, gravity, or matter waves. </p>

<p style="color:darkorange;"> I am an open source software and hardware enthusiast, microscopy, and optics hobbyist, and applied physics afficionado. If you know a wave I don't know, let me know and let's build an interferometer!</p>
